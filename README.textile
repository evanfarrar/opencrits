h1. OpenCrits
h2. Long distance, indoor cycling software

Well, there is opensprints for short, 400 meter races. But if you want to run an event more similar to typical cycling events (i.e. _endurance_) you could just set the race distance to 60km, or you could use this!

h2. Features

* Time based: 30 minutes (configurable).
* 8 racers: wire together two opensprints mainboards to acheive 8 racers.
* Forkmountless: This is intended for use without a forkmount.
* Safety measures: fall off 3 times and you're eliminated.
